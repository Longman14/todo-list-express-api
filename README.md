Certainly! Here's a sample GitHub README.md file for your Node.js Express.js API code:

```markdown
# Task Management API

This is a simple RESTful API built using Node.js and Express.js for managing tasks. It includes features such as task creation, reading tasks, updating tasks, deleting tasks, and rate limiting for API requests.

## Features

- Create a new task.
- Read all tasks.
- Read a specific task by ID.
- Update a task by ID.
- Delete a task by ID.
- Rate limiting to prevent excessive API requests from the same IP address.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the API up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-management-api.git
cd task-management-api
```

2. Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Start the server.

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /tasks`: Create a new task.
- `GET /tasks`: Read all tasks.
- `GET /tasks/:id`: Read a specific task by ID.
- `PUT /tasks/:id`: Update a task by ID.
- `DELETE /tasks/:id`: Delete a task by ID.

## Rate Limiting

The API includes rate limiting to prevent abuse. By default, each IP address is limited to 5 requests per minute.

If a client exceeds this limit, a `429 Too Many Requests` response will be sent.

## Data Persistence

Task data is stored in a JSON file named `savedText.json`. Any changes made to tasks are written to this file to ensure data persistence.
